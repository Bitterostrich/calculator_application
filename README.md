Repository for Casio fx-83GT Plus calculator app

The calculator is built using Javascript with Tailwind for the Frontend Design.

The calculator is capable of:
-- Basic operations (addition, division, multiplication and substraction)
-- It is able to chain operations and provide a total when the equals button is clicked. 
-- It refreshes when the on button is clicked and the delete button works just fine to clear inputs. 
-- The all clear button wipes all inputs from the calculator. 

Issues with the calculator: 
--The calculator was intended as a scientific calculator but due to my inability to add a cursor that can be used for navigating through each input, implementing more complex functions is impossible.
