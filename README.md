# Calculator Application

## Repository for Casio fx-83GT Plus Calculator App

### Overview
This repository contains the code for a calculator app modeled after the Casio fx-83GT Plus. The calculator is built using JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for the frontend design.

### Features
The calculator is capable of the following functionalities:
- Basic operations including addition, division, multiplication, and subtraction.
- Ability to chain operations and provide a total when the equals button is clicked.
- Refresh functionality when the 'On' button is clicked.
- The delete button to clear the current input.
- An 'All Clear' button to reset all inputs.

### Issues
- The calculator was initially intended to function as a scientific calculator. However, due to challenges in implementing a movable cursor for navigating through inputs, more complex functions could not be added.

### Contribution
Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting or implementing improvements, especially in addressing the current limitations.
